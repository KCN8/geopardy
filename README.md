## App Summary

My project is a trivia app based on Jeopardy. I call it Geopardy! The app generates random categories and questions. The user can select a difficulty level of question with a corresponding point value from the board. The user must answer the question and will be awarded the points accordingly. All feedback has been good, though there are some bugs still. I got to the point that the app is at by following my user stories and prioritizing the features I really wanted to get working.
